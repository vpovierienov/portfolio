Front-End Developer focused on building clean, responsive, and pixel-perfect websites and landing pages.
I work with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), and React.js, using modern UI frameworks like Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap.
I pay close attention to performance, SEO basics, cross-browser compatibility, and code quality, and I use Git and REST APIs in everyday development.
